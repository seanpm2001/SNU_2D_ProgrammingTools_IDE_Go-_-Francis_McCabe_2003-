# Go! Compiler

This is a compiler for the Go! programming language by Francis McCabe. It was re-uploaded in 2015 to GitHub and is re-uploaded here, as it is historical, and serves as a good example for basing the web IDE off of. The original can be found [here](https://github.com/fgmccabe/go/)

## Legal

The licenses are compatible, as the GNU GPL2 states that it can be upgraded to any version (including GNU GPL3) and since the files are in tact, the license agreement is being followed fully.

## Notes

**Note:** this is NOT [Google](https://github.com/Google/) [Golang](https://github.com/golang/go/), this is the [Go!](https://github.com/fgmccabe/go/) language by [Francis McCabe](https://github.com/fgmccabe/).

There were some blank files, and some other files that couldn't be uploaded. Blank files had a space added to them, in some spots, I zipped them up as I didn't want to modify over 40 files, and also I can't upload broken symbolic links, it isn't possible.

### Personal notes

**Personal note:** while re-uploading this here, I became even more frustrated by how Google steamrolled this project, as I can see that tons of effort was put into this project, and Google responded with just 1 word "unfortunate" to a project that took years of work.
